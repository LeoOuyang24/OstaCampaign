 name: "Empess"
 type: "Town"
 text: >
      A Valar colony that declared itself independent after the split of Valance, Empess has grown to a medium sized town. Its location beneath the Saka mountains grants it fresh ice melt in the spring, lush grass for wandering animals, and a convenient trading spot with the Sakan goliaths. These attributes make it an ideal home for wandering traders and nomadic farmers.
