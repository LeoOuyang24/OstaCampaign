      Located between the paranoid Plutans and the greedy Tychans are the Caeriks, gnomes who have carved out their own identity as fat, lazy, and naive farmeres, content to watch livestock eat grass all day as opposed to taking action. Despite this stereotype, Caerik gnomes have an important niche as the most important farmers in the region, mostly of meat, their main export being the island's cattle-sized rats, who also serve as their main source of dairy and transportation. Their neighbors may call them "rat people", but the Caeriks always know, it is their rats, domesticated and trained for purposes ranging from meat to message carrying, that keeps the archipelago alliance going.
