      The etymology of Litharius is not entirely known, but it's believed to derive from an ancient word meaning "warden" or "jailor", a fitting name given its brutal population of monstrosities ranging from hill giants to galeb dhur to even black dragons. Caught in the middle of this mess are the Lithian orcs, brutal warmongers that are more than aware of just how insignificant they are compared to the rest of the island's denizens. Few orcs see their 40th birthday, so they live fast impulsive lives, usually centered around dominating as many lesser beings as possible, whether that be weaker orc tribes, a lonely hill giant, or their gnomish neighbors to the south.
