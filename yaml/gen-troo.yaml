      Known as the "The Devourer", the Gen-Troo desert is amongst the oldest antagonists on the continent. It's said that the first Valar king was orphaned there. Larkwood elders tell of countless young eyed adventurers who disappeared into the desert. King Liam, the bastard king, would himself vanish into the sands, under circumstances still poorly understood. Across history, the desert serves as the ultimate constant, a reminder of the death that awaits us all.
