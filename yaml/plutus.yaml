        The rock gnomes of Plutus live in not only the least lush island on the chain, but also the one closest to their greatest enemy, the Lithian orcs. With their odds tipped against them, Plutan gnomes have turned to magic, notably transmutation; in the modern day, this has manifested in the form of a small sand golem army, prepared by the government in case of times of invasion. Plutus also holds an uneasy alliance with its sister islands, as much in the interest of defense as in the interest of trade.
