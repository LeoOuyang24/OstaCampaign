    The seat of power on Osta for thousands of years, Valance remains a shining capital today. Its might can still be felt in its naval power, rivaled only by the kingdom of Braadish, and its academic institutions, which are amongst the finest places to study the arcane in the world. Young students of the arcane and/or sword will find themselves more than at home in the halls of Valance.

      Of course, it's impossible to discuss Valance without also mentioning its fall from grace. For countless generations, the Valars controlled both golden coasts, which in turn meant control of the entire southern sector of Osta. "King of Valance" really was synonymous with "King of the whole continent". It wasn't until about a thousand years ago, when King Arlo Lance had his dreaded two sons. It was not unusual of course for a ruler to have multiple sons or even no sons; the throne had seen its fair share of Queens. But for the older child to be born out of wedlock? That was unheard of, or at least never previously discovered. Prince Liam and his 5 days younger brother Charles would be thrust into a controversy they had no hand in, forced to solve a problem they did not cause. And though they were able to resolve the issue amicably, causing the modern kingdoms of Valance and Braadish, some in the high courts of Valance did not enjoy having their influence literally cut in half, a resentment only further deepened by the later seccession of several northern states.

      King Charles Braad, first ruler of Braadish, would die in his late 80s, his long human life well-lived. But King Liam Lance of Valance and his part elven heart would remain pumping for centuries. Many of his relatives and court nobles lived even longer. They held long memories, whispered long plans, and, when the day came, left long stories. Stories that, if the rumors are to be believed, still fester in the high courts even today.
