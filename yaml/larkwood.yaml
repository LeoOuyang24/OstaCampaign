      Once a vasal state of the Valance Kingdom, Larkwood is now a self-governing autonomous region, run by a democratically elected council. Its mostly elven population produced and still does produce most of the continent's fruit and vegetables, and druidic magic is at its highest here. The dense foliage and hilly mountains of Larkwood serve as a barrier for many adventurers, perhaps a necessary protection from the more dangerous biomes of the north.
