 name: "Empess Eastern Port"
 type: "POI"
 text:  "The eastern region of Empess is a common meeting point for Empess farmers and Sakan traders. As a result, Braadish traders often barter for Sakan goods here, typically frostberries and bear flesh, though the occasional white dragon scales, yeti blood and even frostbark will pop up for the willing and morally questionable bidder."
