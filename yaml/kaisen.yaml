  Valar traders first made contact with the Kaisen elves sometime after the 3rd Valan king. Few sources remain from that time and they rarely corroborate each other. Some claimed them to be heavily superstitious. Others said they were into gods, though they could never agree on the exact number. A few claimed they were heavily xenophobic, while others said they were hospitable and welcoming.
