    A formerly small coastal village with a long history, Braadish is now the seat of power for the kingdom of Braad. It is known for its excellent seafaring technology and rich mineral deposits, which bolster some of the best metal working on the continent of Osta. In fact some of the best weapons on the continent, both legal and illegal, can be found in the trade sectors of Braadish. Its strong economy attracts both the wealthy and the poor alike, the former seeking glory, the latter seeking beginnings.
