      The Saka mountains' frigid year-round temperatures ensure that only the toughest creatures can survive. Yetis, white dragons, and remorhazz make the place a deathtrap for most adventurers. But for the ancient Sakan goliaths, it's home. Tough but peaceful, the goliaths are amongst the oldest civilizations on the continent. They live tribal lives extolling strength and wisdom. Some occasionally leave their ancestral lands to seek glory as adventurers or traveling traders.
