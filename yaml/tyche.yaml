      The Gnomish archipelago's isolation from mainland Osta has created a unique ecosystem not found anywhere else. Each island contains fauna with size completely reversed from the mainland. The largest island, Tyche, is a dense forest of tree-sized ferns and mosses. Massive arthropods replace dragons and owlbears, who rarely get larger than a mainland cat.

      In this strange environment, the Tychan gnomes have forged a kingdom which dominates the other islands, thanks to its steady access of valuable metals, most notably gold. Domesticated Tychan turtles the size of a bull serve as their traveling companion while pseudodragons serve as common pets. In times past, Tyche was a heavily taxed state of Valance; now it remains a valued trading partner to both Valance and Braadish. Amongst the other islands within the Gnomish archipelago, the kingdom has served as both a symbol of strength and oppression. In the modern day, the kingdom of Tyche holds an uneasy alliance with its sister kingdoms of Plutus and Caerik, united only by their common enemy: the Lithian orcs.
